While you're waiting, you can sign into your Google for Non-Profits account at any time to check the status of your application.
4. **Start signing up for exclusive products!**Once your organisation has been approved for Google for Non-Profits, you can begin signing up for products. Learn about how to sign up for specific products [here][3].

# Eligibility guidelines

Organisations that meet the following criteria are eligible to participate in the Google for Non-Profits programme

## Are you eligible for Google for Non-Profits?

## Important Eligibility Details:

At present, Google for Nonprofits is open only to organizations in the countries listed [here][0].

Organizations based in other countries can view Google's [country-specific programs][1] for nonprofits.

Make sure your organisation meets the following requirements:

1. Google is working with [TechSoup][2] to provide access to Google products and services. To be eligible for the Google for Nonprofits programme, organisations must:
  * Have a validated account with TechSoup's local partner. (Not currently a member of TechSoup? Register [here][3]).
  * Be a registered and recognized charity or nonprofit as described [here][0].
  * Acknowledge and agree to the application's required certification regarding nondiscrimination and donation receipt of use.
2. Please note that the following organisations are not eligible for Google for Non-Profits:
  * Governmental entities and organisations;
  * Hospitals and health care organisations;
  * Schools, childcare centres, academic institutions and universities (philanthropic arms of educational organisations are eligible). To learn more about Google's programmes for educational institutions, visit [Google in Education][4].
3. Google reserves the right to grant or deny an organization's application or participation at any time, for any reason, and to supplement or amend these eligibility guidelines at any time. Selections are made at Google's sole discretion, and are not subject to external review.
